# ugc-creator

A Claude Code **skill** that turns Claude into a hyper-realistic AI UGC influencer
studio. Built by [@0x_Anni](https://x.com/0x_Anni); the full system, the economics,
and the story behind it are in [the article](https://x.com/0x_Anni/status/2067776249485791496).

If this saves you time, star the repo. It helps more builders find it. It treats a synthetic influencer as **data** (a JSON identity card) plus a
deterministic **6-layer prompt assembler**, so the same person comes out in every
shot instead of drifting between generations.

> Don't prompt an AI influencer. **Compile one.**

```

**v2:** adds the reference-lock layer. The card kills prompt-side drift; the
face pack + reference conditioning (cref / PuLID / InstantID for stills, Kling
v3 `elements` for video, LoRA for permanent rosters) kills sampler-side drift.
The script now targets Kling 3.0 and takes the face pack via `--element-frontal`.

## Install

One command, into your global Claude Code skills directory:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xAnni/ugc-creator.git ~/.claude/skills/ugc-creator
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/0xAnni/ugc-creator.git $env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\ugc-creator
```

Or install per-project instead: clone (or copy the folder) into
`<your-project>/.claude/skills/ugc-creator/`.

No git? Download the zip: **Code → Download ZIP**, unzip, and put the
`ugc-creator` folder in the same path.

Claude Code auto-discovers it. The skill triggers on requests like *"make my AI
influencer consistent,"* *"generate a week of UGC for my AI girl,"* or *"write a
Kling video prompt."*

## Quickstart

1. **Create an actor**: "Build me a UGC actor: Swedish, early 20s, beachy." Claude
   writes an identity card to `assets/actors/`.
2. **Generate a shot**: give a one-line brief:
   `Lila, just out of the sea, wet hair, golden hour`
   Claude returns a full positive + negative prompt to paste into your image model.
3. **Generate a week**: give seven one-liners; the consistency protocol keeps her
   the same person in every frame.
4. **Animate**: feed a still + a motion prompt to `scripts/generate_video.py`
   (needs `pip install fal-client` and a `FAL_KEY`).

## The idea in one line

Identity is a JSON schema, not a re-uploaded image, so consistency is
deterministic instead of hopeful. Build the engine once; generate forever.
